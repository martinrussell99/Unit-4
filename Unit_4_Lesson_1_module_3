1. Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease.
This would be a supervised learning problem, you would need a lot of data to train a model for this.

2.  Translate a set of images into variables for modeling
You could probably use both for this problem, as long as the set of images was large enough to train the model with.

3.  An ecommerce company wants to identify power users
Since we aren't exactly sure what a power user is, I'm going to say unsupervised learning would be best, we don't exactly know what our outcome variable will be.

4.  That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users
Since there is no outcome variable, this would be an unsupervised learning model.

5.  You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model
From what I've learned from the previous sections, I would use PCA to do this, and PCA can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised machine learing.
